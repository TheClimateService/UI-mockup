# Corn yield reduction as function of log10(drought return period) based on historical data.
return_period_yrs = c(1.01,2,5,10,20,50,100)
yield_reduction_pct = c(0,5,12,15,20,24,31)
model <- lm(yield_reduction_pct ~ poly(log10(return_period_yrs),1,raw=TRUE))
summary(model)

# NOTE THAT THE FUNCTION IS DESIGNED TO OPERATE ON LOG10 OF THE RETURN PERIOD.
# Example:  f4yield_reduction_pct(2.0) = 30.07868
# Coefficients are intercept and the cofficient of each power of t from 1 to 1.
# Could also use coef(summary(model))[1,1], [2,1], [3,1], and [4,1]
f4yield_reduction_pct = function(t) {summary(model)$coefficients[1,1] + summary(model)$coefficients[2,1]*t }
