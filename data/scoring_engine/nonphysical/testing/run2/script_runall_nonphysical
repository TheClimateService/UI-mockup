# SCRIPT TO RUN MAJOR STEPS IN GENERATION OF NON-PHYSICAL RISKS.
# TT - January 2017

# Execution:  	./script_runall_nonphysical <physical damages file>
# Example:	./script_runall_nonphysical TCSDB_structure_locations.csv.damages.allDFs

# Get input.
alldamages=$1

# Get the needed files from tabs in the TCSDB xlsx file.
# This generates locations.csv, locations4SE.csv, locationvalues4SE.csv, riskfactors.csv, subcat.csv, cat.csv, and corp.csv
# This is now done from script_runall in the scoring_engine directory.  The above files are put in the non-physical directory.
# disabled for local testing:  cd ../../..
#Rscript ./data/scoring_engine/nonphysical/load_tcsdb_4scoringengine.r 

# Run the non-physical scoring.  
# This assumes that the physical scoring has already been run in ./data/scoring_engine generating the alldamages input file called above.
# It also assumes that this file is present in the scoring_engine directory.
# script_locationvalues_v1 applies the location values associated with each damage function and produces $alldamages.withvalues
# disabled for local testing:  cd ./data/scoring_engine/nonphysical/
# disabled for local testing:  cp ../$alldamages ./
./script_locationvalues_v1 locationvalues4SE.csv $alldamages
