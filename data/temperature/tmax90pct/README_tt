1.  The following scripts extract timeseries, create period averages, apply damage functions, and score each location:

	script_extract_timeseries_v1
	script_period_averages_v1
	script_process_location_v1
	script_process_location_runall
	script_score_locations_tx90p_v1

Instructions on how to run each script are included in each script.  The first two scripts are run externally to the TCS app directory since they involve very large files.  The results of averaging historical data for five 30-year periods and future data for nine 10-year periods are stored within the current app directory at ./data/temperature/tmax90pct.

2.  script_process_location_runall and script_score_locations_tx90p_v1 can be run locally to generate scoring data.  They depend only on the periods files stored here.  Execution is as follows:

	./script_process_location_runall <list of locations> <file of historical period values> <file of rcp85 period values>
	./script_score_locations_tx90p_v1 <damage-function file> <facility location file> <input file of location-specific tx90p data>

The output from the scoring process is in the file <facility list>.tx90p.damages.
