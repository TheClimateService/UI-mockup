Since the sed 's/^M/\n/g' command does not work, use the following to convert a single line csv export from excel into one line per record:

	cat junk | tr "^M" "\n" > junk2  (do not copy/paste this; enter it on the command line)

On the command line, the cntl-M symbol is obtained by entering cntl-V and then cntl-M.
